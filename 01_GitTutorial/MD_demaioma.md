\f0\fs24 \cf0 I like that GitHub allows you to access previous versions of your work.\
\
I don\'92t like that GitHub can have many branches \'97 while it is helpful, it can get confusing.\
\
Question: What do you do if you make a mess of your GitHub repository because you don\'92t know what you did wrong? Should you just revert to a previous version?}
